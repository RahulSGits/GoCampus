GoCampus is a modern, real-time university transit tracking application. It bridges the gap between campus administration, drivers, and students by providing a seamless interface to track university buses in real-time.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Real-Time Bus Tracking:** Leverages WebSockets (`Socket.io`) to stream exact geographical coordinates from drivers to students with sub-second latency.
*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Secure, customized dashboard interfaces for three distinct roles: 
    *   **Students:** View live bus maps, check available seats dynamically, and receive critical push notifications.
    *   **Drivers:** Easy-to-use console to increment/decrement active seat counts and passively broadcast GPS locations.
    *   **Administrators:** A command center to manage fleet operations, assign routes, and dispatch system-wide alerts.
*   **Live Notifications:** A fully synchronized global notification engine with a glowing bell indicator for unread alerts.
*   **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized layout ensuring a flawless experience across all mobile devices, tablets, and desktop viewports.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to run the application locally.

### Prerequisites
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18+)
*   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (Running locally on port 27017 or a MongoDB Atlas URI)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RahulSGits/GoCampus.git
    cd GoCampus
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    # Install backend dependencies
    cd backend
    npm install
    
    # Install frontend dependencies
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Seed the Database** (Optional but recommended for testing)
    This will generate test accounts and initial bus routes.
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run seed
    ```

4.  **Run the Application**
    Open two terminals and start both servers concurrently.
    
    **Terminal 1 (Backend):**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    ```

    **Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

### 🔑 Demo Credentials
